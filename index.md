## About Me

I am Rha Overstreet, and I am a Senior at Lehigh University studying Financial Engineering in the Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) Honors Program with majors in Industrial Systems Engineering and Finance. I expect to graduate in December 2023. 

I am goal oriented, work effectively in high stress situations, and have strong attention to detail skills. Throughout my time at Lehigh I have participated in multiple machine learning in finance research projects, I have represented our Integrated Business and Engineering Honors Program as the Vice President of Professional Development, and I have become a professional proprietary trader.
