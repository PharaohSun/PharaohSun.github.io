_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify correlation with returns](Midterm_report/report.md)**_


### Summary

In this study we compared stocks listed in the S&P500 to their stock prices after their 10-K (mandatory Securities and Exchange Commission) filling where published. The null-hypothesis for this study was "A companies stock price affected by the linguistic sentiment presented in the companies 10-K filing." Linguistic sentiment was determined by 10 variables. 2 positive (negative) libraries created by Tim Loughran and Bill McDonald(LM), Diego Garc√≠aa, Xiaowen Hub, and Maximilian Rohrer(ML) respectivly, along with 3 positive (negative) categorical sentiment libraries created by myself. The sentiment score was determined by using a NEAR_regex function provided by our professor, which can be found in this project repository.
